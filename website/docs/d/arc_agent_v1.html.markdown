# ccloud\_arc\_agent\_v1

Use this data source to get the ID and other attributes of an available Arc
Agent.

The resource can wait for an Arc Agent to be available (the Arc Agent bootstrap
takes time due to compute instance boot time and cloud-init execution delay)
within the `timeouts`
[nested](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#operation-timeouts)
block argument. The default read timeout is 0, what means don't wait.

## Example Usage

### Get an Arc Agent by an agent ID

```hcl
data "ccloud_arc_agent_v1" "agent_1" {
  agent_id = "72f50dc1-03c2-4177-9ffa-d75929734c0d"
}
```

### Find an Arc Agent with a filter

The example below will be completed once it finds the exact one agent
satisfying the specified filter.

```hcl
data "ccloud_arc_agent_v1" "agent_1" {
  filter  = "@metadata_name = 'hostname'"

  timeouts {
    read = "10m"
  }
}
```
