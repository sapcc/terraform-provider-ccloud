# ccloud\_billing\_project\_masterdata

Manages Billing Project masterdata.

~> **Note:** The `terraform destroy` command destroys the
`ccloud_billing_project_masterdata` state, but not the actual billing project
masterdata.

~> **Note:** You _must_ have admin privileges in your OpenStack cloud to use
this resource for other tenant projects.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ccloud_billing_project_masterdata" "masterdata" {
  responsible_primary_contact_id    = "D123456"
  responsible_primary_contact_email = "mail@example.com"

  number_of_endusers = 100

  cost_object {
    inherited = true
  }
}
```
